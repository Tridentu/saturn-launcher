This is the Saturn Launcher documentation site. It was created for documenting the core features of the Launcher, but also for changelogs as well.

## What about the Tridentu-RK Manual?

The manual was only meant for KDE-compatible systems and Tridentu-RK. However, the website is for general use (mainly **OUTSIDE** the Tridentu-RK ecosystem).

## What can be expected from this site?

The following is to be seen on this site:

- Blog posts that act as changelogs for the site and the launcher itself
- Documentation that can be accessed from anywhere
