To search your system, just select the search bar at the top of the launcher.

Then, type what you want to look for in the search box mentioned above.


## Customizing search.

There are plans for a more versatile search system. However,

you can customize the search functionality using KRunner plugins.

To do so, just click the **Configure** button next to it.
